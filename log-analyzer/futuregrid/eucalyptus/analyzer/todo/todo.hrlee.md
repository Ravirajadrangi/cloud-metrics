Hyungro Lee's todo list
=======================

This is only for H. Lee to remember what needs to be done by himself.

`Gregor asked as follows: Feb 28th 10:00am / Due by Mar 2nd (Fri)
1. By this week Friday, I like that the setup is completed so that Sharif can use easy install
2. By this week Friday I like that all documentation and man pages actually be implemented while using argparse
3. By this week Friday I want that I/you and Fugang can check out the code and run the analysis over the weekend to produce the graphs you have already worked on.
4. On Monday I liek to make sure that the updated script is handed over to Sharif for inspection

Sharif can than decide if he wants to put the "final version" of the euca-log file management program into production or wait till Greg's departure is completed.
`

* Rename & reorganize directory structure
 - /eucalyptus-cloud-metrics/log-analyzer/futuregrid/eucalyptus/analyzer

* Define required user input when installation proceeds
 - e.g.) log directory path (/var/log/eucalyptus)
