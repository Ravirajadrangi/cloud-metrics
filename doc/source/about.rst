About
=====
We are developing an open source code that allows to analyze the log
files for various cloud infrastructure tools.

At this time, we are focusing on the development of a tool to analyze
eucalyptus log data. It will include

* a framework to explore the data via a shell
* a framework to display the data
* a mechanism to replace the charting library
* a web framework (currently based on php)

[Note: we may abandon the development of the php framework as it has
cost too much time to develop.  We provide a simple php framework that
displays the information in some web pages.]
