Draft
=====

This draft contains possible software developments plans. 
Each file should express an idea and details to implement
 and if it is decided whether to implement or not, we add
prefix 'confirmed.' or 'remained.'. 'confirmed.' means we
will implement the idea in a next version of a software,
and 'remained.' means we are not going to implement the
idea at this time.

GitHub issues, milestones
-------------------------

We are maintaining our software development ideas via 
GitHub issue tracking system, and this Draft directory
will support the system in a various way such as attaching
documents (.doc, .pdf, etc) and images (.png, .gif, .jpg,
 etc)
